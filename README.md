# dracula-flub

This is a retarded shitpost that I thought of during a TF2 full moon to use with my dracula medic fit.
ower 
I am not a programmer, this is a retarded shitpost. Excluding white space, this script is eight lines of code.

The script opens bars.txt, which contains a transcript of Dracula Flow 1-4, and copies it to the clipboard. I run the script through a terminal command bound to a hotkey.

If you would like to use this, I suggest you do the same. Be sure that the file is pointing to the correct directory (windows users will need to change it).

I am not a programmer. I am not a software developer. To use this powerful script, to gain the power of the Dracula flow himself, you must figure out how to run this on your system. Install Python, install spyder or whatever the fuck IDE you want to use. Use Windows notepad for all I care. Only the worthy will wield this power, and the worthy are those who know how to run a Python script.
